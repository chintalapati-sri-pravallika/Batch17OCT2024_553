DAY-8 (5-11)
	else if ladder
•	it tries to check all the if else if conditions unless the condition satisfies or then goes to else condition, so it takes time.
•	if condition holds strings, float values we use else if ladder
•	can test relational conditions
	switch – to check single characters, ascii, integer conditions 
•	switch(cond)
{
case ‘1’:
	…
	break;
case ‘2’:
	…
	break;
default:
	…
	break; - it is not mandatory because this is the final label
}
•	should not have duplicate cases in switch
i.	case 66:			
case ‘B’:
ii.	case ‘B’:		
case ‘B’:
gives an error as duplicate cases are not allowed
	looping: do while, while, for
•	initialization
condition check
statements to be executed
counter
•	two types of loops: entry controlled (while, for loop), exit controlled (do while)
•	do {
sts
} while(cond);
•	;(semi colon) is used after while condition in do while because
•	For(initialization section ;condition section ;counter section){}
•	Initializing and counter we can use more than one variable in for loop so it is powerful than while loop
•	We can vomit one or more section in for loop
