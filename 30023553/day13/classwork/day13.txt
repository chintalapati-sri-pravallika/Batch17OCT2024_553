DAY-13 (12-11)
	Union - The members of the union can be accessed one at a time.
•	It is almost same as structure accept this one property
•	Union has the size of the data type which has greater size
•	Eg : union item{
int m;
float x;
char c;
};

char c
int m
float x
the size of the union in this example is 4 bytes
	Enum (enumeration) – 
                                                             



                                                                File handling
•	File is collection of logically related information
•	Two types:
1)	Sequential file
2)	Random access file
•	Use special structure named FILE
•	FILE *fp; – file pointer
•	FILE *fopen(char *name,char *mode) – to open a file
name of the file, mode you want use in the file - are arguments given to the fopen (mode can be read,write,append)
•	Once file is opened it returns the file address to file pointer
•	/*
	FILE => DS
	fp => file pointer to FILE DS

	fopen("name of the file","mode") => opening the file
	mode => r,w,a,r+,w+,a+

	fclose(fp) => close the opened file

	read/write
	fprintf,fscanf => formated writing and reading resp
	fputs,fgets => unformated i/o operation
	fwrite/fread => reading/writing binary objects
 
*/
•	By using system, we can’t use linux commands
•	fseek
•	fread();
	fread (
	fread returns the size of how may no of bytes it is read
•	fwrite ();/
	fread (
	fwrite returns the size of how may no of bytes it is written
