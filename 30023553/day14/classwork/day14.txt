	Multi-threading: 
•	Lwt/lwp – light weight thread or light weight process
•	Thread – 
•	Process – 
•	Concurrency – to perform multiple task(functions) simultaneously
•	Concurrency in programming:
-	Multithreading: multiple threads within a single process are created to perform different parts of task or handle multiple tasks concurrently.
	threads share the same memory space – leads to race condition (to avoid race condition we need to use lock).
-	Multiprocessing: separate processes are created to handle different tasks concurrently
	Each process has own memory space
	Requires inter process communication (IPC) methods like pipes or shared memory 
-	Asynchronous programming: non-blocking functions are used to handle tasks such as I/O operations without blocking the main thread, 
•	Concurrency is about dealing with multiple tasks at once or having multiple threads
Parallelism is executing multiple tasks truly simultaneously, achieved by having multiple CPU cores.
